1.  Pyramids: Use a for loop to build a pyramid of x’s.
    It should be modular so that if you loop to 5 or 50, it still creates evenly spaced rows. 
    Hint: Multiply the string “x” by the row. For example, if you loop to the range of 4, it should produce the following result:
>>> x
>>> x x
>>> x x x

2. Output Names: Write a loop that will iterate over a list of items and 
    only output items which have letters inside of a string.
Take the following list, for example, only “John” and “Amanda” should be output:
>>> names = ['John', ' ', 'Amanda', 5]

3. Convert Celsius: Given a list of temperatures that are in Celsius,
    write a loop that iterates over the list and outputs the temperature converted into Fahrenheit.
    Hint: The conversion is “F = (9/5) ∗ C + 32”:
>>> temps = [32, 12, 44, 29]
    Output would be [89.6, 53.6, 111.2, 84.2]
