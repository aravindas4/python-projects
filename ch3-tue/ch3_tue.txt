Checking Inclusion – Part 1: Ask the user for input, and check to see if what
they wrote includes an “es”.

Checking Inclusion – Part 2: Ask the user for input, and check to see if what they wrote has an “ing” at the end. Hint: Use slicing.

Checking Equality: Ask the user to input two words, and write a conditional statement to check if both words are the same. 
Make it case insensitive so that capitals do not matter.

Returning Exponents: Ask for the user to input a number, and return that number squared if it is lower than 10.
Hint: Investigate arithmetic expressions for exponents.
