1. User Input: Write a while loop that continues to ask for user input and runs
until they type “quit”.
2. Double Loop: Write a for loop within a while loop that will count from 0 to 5,
    but when it reaches 3, it sets a game_over variable to True and breaks out of the loop.
    the while loop should continue to loop until game_over is True.
    the output should only be 0, 1, 2
