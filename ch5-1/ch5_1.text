User Input: ask the user to input a word,and pass that word into a function
            that checks if the word starts with an uppercase.
            If it does output “True”, otherwise “False”.

No Name: Define a function that takes in two arguments, first_name and last_ name, 
        and makes both optional. If no values are passed into the parameters, 
        it should output “No name passed in”; otherwise, it should print out the name.
