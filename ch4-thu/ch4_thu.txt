1. Remove Duplicates: remove all duplicates from the list below.
 hint: Use the .count( ) method. the output should be [‘Bob’, ‘Kenny’, ‘Amanda’]
>>> names = ['Bob', 'Kenny', 'Amanda', 'Bob', 'Kenny']
2. User Input: Use a while loop to continually ask the user to input a word,
    until they type “quit ”. once they type a word in, add it to a list
    once they quit the loop, use a for loop to output all items within the list.
